# Scrambled Eggs

Scrambled eggs is a ECMAScript library for generating matrix barcodes.

"QR Code" is a trademark, so we don't use that.

The code on which this library is based is [here](https://github.com/davidshimjs/qrcodejs), and like that code this library is released under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

This repo is an ES'15 module based build for those who want that. If you just want to include a file in your HTML, use the [scrambled-eggs.js](https://github.com/TrevorFSmith/scrambled-eggs/blob/master/dist/scrambled-eggs.js) in the `dist` folder.
